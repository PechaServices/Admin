Request for Work
All work on OpenPecha is done through Requests for Work (RFWs). This has two benefits: The requester has to 1) think about whether the requested work is necessary and 2) describe the requested work in detail. Together with Requests for Comments (RFCs), RFWs ensure that developers only do essential work. They also prevent misunderstandings that lead to abandoning incorrect code and having to change direction midway through a project. Thus RFWs and RFCs lead to less lost time, more productivity, and more successful outcomes.

The benefit for developers is this. Since the requester and commenter have to come to an agree

Once the owner of the work provides a RFC and the requester and owner agree to the terms and definitions, the owner has the freedom to complete the work in whatever way they want. Since the developer understands the reasoning behind the RFW, the conceptual framework, and what is to be done, it ensures that any decision they make is well informed.
